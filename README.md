# portfolio-two

This is the second version of my portfolio website.

Developed purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Primary goal of this site is twofold:

1. Be the anchor point of my brand as a developer, coach, and mind/body artist.
2. Be designed and developed mobile first and responsive without the aid of any frameworks like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc.
